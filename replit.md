## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite.
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn/UI components (built on Radix UI), styled with Tailwind CSS and custom theming (German locale, brand-specific green color scheme).
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Animations**: Subtle, performance-optimized fade-in and slide-up animations for enhanced UX.
- **Responsiveness**: Complete mobile optimization across all components including hero section, service cards, gallery, contact forms, and footer.
- **Privacy**: 100% DSGVO-compliant cookie consent system with granular options and conditional loading of analytics.
- **SEO**: Auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, canonical URLs, structured data (Local Business, BlogPosting, Service, FAQ, WebSite), comprehensive SEOHead component (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, geo tags), and local SEO optimization for M端nchen.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript, ES modules).
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for contact form submissions and blog content.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized middleware.
- **Logging**: Custom request logging.
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware integration.

### Data Storage Solutions
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
- **Database**: Primarily PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database); however, a robust JSON-based FileStorage system in `./data/` is implemented as the primary persistent storage solution, ensuring data survives container restarts without PostgreSQL dependency. An in-memory storage fallback is also present.
- **Schema**: Shared definitions between frontend and backend.
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management.

### Authentication and Authorization
- Basic user schema present; no active authentication system is currently in use but designed for future admin panel integration.
